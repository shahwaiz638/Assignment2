## Project Description
The Decentralized FAST Cafeteria Shopping System is a decentralized application (DAPP) designed to revolutionize the cafeteria experience for students and staff at FAST University. It aims to provide a seamless and transparent platform for ordering meals, processing transactions, handling payments via cryptocurrency, and rewarding loyal customers.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: The DAPP uses multiple smart contracts to manage functionalities such as menu management, order processing, payments, loyalty rewards, and promotions.

2. **Web3 Application**: The web application is developed in JavaScript using the React framework. It allows cafeteria staff to update menu items, offer discounts and promotions, and manage the loyalty program. Users can browse the menu, place orders, make payments using utility tokens, and view their loyalty rewards and promotions.

## Smart Contracts
The following smart contracts are supported by the DAPP:

1. **Menu Management Contract**: Manages the cafeteria menu, including items, prices, and availability.
2. **Order Processing Contract**: Facilitates the order processing system, allowing users to select items, specify quantities, and place orders.
3. **Payment Contract (ERC20)**: Implements the FastCoin token as an ERC20 token standard, serving as a utility token for financial transactions within the cafeteria system.
4. **Rewards and Loyalty Contract**: Establishes a rewards and loyalty program, encouraging users to earn tokens based on their purchasing behavior.
5. **Promotions and Discounts Contract**: Introduces a dynamic promotions system, allowing cafeteria staff to offer discounts or special promotions.

## Web Integration
The web application supports the following user interactions:

- **Cafeteria Staff**: Can log in to update the menu items and prices, offer discounts and special promotions.
- **Cafeteria Users**: Can log in to browse the menu, place orders, make payments using utility tokens, view their loyalty rewards and promotions.

## Project Submission
The project submission deadline is 06th January 2024. Late submissions or ones sent by email will not be accepted.
